# bethere

Experimental unfinished application, that aims to be like a contact list of friends and family where I can log the last time I talked with them, so I can be aware of that and call them or something.

### Tech

- I want to use [Druid](https://github.com/linebender/druid), the coolest Rust UI library I have seen.
- I'm also creating my own config file thing, a simple key/value tabbed file, maybe this is a chance to experiment with creating my own crate library.
